The Muscle BioAmp Shield is a piece of hardware specifically made for neuroscience enthusiasts and it is heavily inspired by the [DIY Muscle SpikerShield](https://backyardbrains.com/products/diyMuscleSpikerShield) from [BackYard Brains](https://backyardbrains.com/). It allows you to perform all the experiments that you can perform using the SpikerShield and even more. The Muscle BioAmp Shield allows you to record the signal via a direct connection from Arduino to PC and using Spike Recorder software on your Mobile & PC. You can visualize the EMG signal on the LED bank of the shield, it can also be done via the Spike Recorder App, and the Arduino serial plotter is also a good visualization software for the Muscle BioAmp Shield. You can also hear the signal using a pair of headphones or on a portable speaker using the audio cable provided with the Muscle BioAmp Shield. This is an all-in-one package for all the neuroscience enthusiasts out there looking for something affordable and fun!

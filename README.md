Muscle BioAmp Shield is an all-in-one Arduino Uno ElectroMyography (EMG) shield for learning neuroscience with ease. It is inspired from Back Yard Brains (BYB) Spiker shield and provides similar features like user buttons & LED Bar. It is perfect for beginners as they can easily stack it on top of Arduino Uno to record, visualize and listen to the muscle signals to make amazing projects in Human-Computer Interface (HCI).
